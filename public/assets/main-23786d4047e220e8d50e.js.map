For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t   *\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t   *     }\n\t   *\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   */\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n\t    return converter ?\n\t      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n\t      fromJSDefault(json);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function isPlainObj(value) {\n\t    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var src_Math__imul =\n\t    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n\t    Math.imul :\n\t    function imul(a, b) {\n\t      a = a | 0; // int\n\t      b = b | 0; // int\n\t      var c = a & 0xffff;\n\t      var d = b & 0xffff;\n\t      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n\t      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n\t    };\n\t\n\t  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n\t  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n\t  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n\t  // the sign bit.\n\t  function smi(i32) {\n\t    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function hash(o) {\n\t    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t      return 0;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      o = o.valueOf();\n\t      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t        return 0;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (o === true) {\n\t      return 1;\n\t    }\n\t    var type = typeof o;\n\t    if (type === 'number') {\n\t      var h = o | 0;\n\t      if (h !== o) {\n\t        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t      }\n\t      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n\t        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t        h ^= o;\n\t      }\n\t      return smi(h);\n\t    }\n\t    if (type === 'string') {\n\t      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n\t      return o.hashCode();\n\t    }\n\t    return hashJSObj(o);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function cachedHashString(string) {\n\t    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n\t    if (hash === undefined) {\n\t      hash = hashString(string);\n\t      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n\t        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n\t        stringHashCache = {};\n\t      }\n\t      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n\t      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n\t    }\n\t    return hash;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n\t  function hashString(string) {\n\t    // This is the hash from JVM\n\t    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n\t    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n\t    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n\t    // the string.

   Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n\t      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t      registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n\t      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t      Terminology\n\t      -----------\n\t\n\t      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t      itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t      Basic Usage:\n\t      ------------\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t        // on success\n\t        resolve(value);\n\t\n\t        // on failure\n\t        reject(reason);\n\t      });\n\t\n\t      promise.then(function(value) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Advanced Usage:\n\t      ---------------\n\t\n\t      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      function getJSON(url) {\n\t        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t          xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t          xhr.send();\n\t\n\t          function handler() {\n\t            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t              if (this.status === 200) {\n\t                resolve(this.response);\n\t              } else {\n\t                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          };\n\t        });\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t        // on fulfillment\n\t      }, function(reason) {\n\t        // on rejection\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      Promise.all([\n\t        getJSON('/posts'),\n\t        getJSON('/comments')\n\t      ]).then(function(values){\n\t        values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t        return values;\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      @class Promise\n\t      @param {function} resolver\n\t      Useful for tooling.\n\t      @constructor\n\t    */\n\t    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n\t      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n\t      this._state = undefined;\n\t      this._result = undefined;\n\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n\t        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n\t          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\t\n\t    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n\t      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t      ```js\n\t      findUser().then(function(user){\n\t        // user is available\n\t      }, function(reason){\n\t        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t      });\n\t      ```\n\t\n\t      Chaining\n\t      --------\n\t\n\t      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n    return converter ?\n      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n      fromJSDefault(json);\n  }\n\n  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function isPlainObj(value) {\n    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n  }\n\n  var src_Math__imul =\n    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n    Math.imul :\n    function imul(a, b) {\n      a = a | 0; // int\n      b = b | 0; // int\n      var c = a & 0xffff;\n      var d = b & 0xffff;\n      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n    };\n\n  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n  // the sign bit.\n  function smi(i32) {\n    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n  }\n\n  function hash(o) {\n    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n      o = o.valueOf();\n      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n        return 0;\n      }\n    }\n    if (o === true) {\n      return 1;\n    }\n    var type = typeof o;\n    if (type === 'number') {\n      var h = o | 0;\n      if (h !== o) {\n        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n      }\n      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n        h ^= o;\n      }\n      return smi(h);\n    }\n    if (type === 'string') {\n      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n    }\n    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n      return o.hashCode();\n    }\n    return hashJSObj(o);\n  }\n\n  function cachedHashString(string) {\n    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n    if (hash === undefined) {\n      hash = hashString(string);\n      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n        stringHashCache = {};\n      }\n      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n    }\n    return hash;\n  }\n\n  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n  function hashString(string) {\n    // This is the hash from JVM\n    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n    // the string.

The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        }\n\n        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n        }\n\n        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var author, books;\n\n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n\n      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n      }\n\n      function failure(reason) {\n\n      }\n\n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfilled\n      @param {Function} onRejected\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      then: function(onFulfillment, onRejection) {\n        var parent = this;\n        var state = parent._state;\n\n        if (state === lib$es6$promise$$internal$$FULFILLED && !onFulfillment || state === lib$es6$promise$$internal$$REJECTED && !onRejection) {\n          return this;\n        }\n\n        var child = new this.constructor(lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop);\n        var result = parent._result;\n\n        if (state) {\n          var callback = arguments[state -
